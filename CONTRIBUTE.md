### **How to contribute?** 

* Open a **pull request** explaining your addition/fix. If it is an addition of a class or an algorithm please explain why it's useful and provide a url to a wikipedia page for the algorithm/data structure you're suggesting. *(Note that the code **must** follow our code-style to be accepted)*.

* Implementation is not everyting, you have to provide test cases in the **tests** folder for **EVERY** function you implement(see how to write unit tests [here](UNIT_TESTS.md)).

* Last but not least, you have to write some documentation in the **tutorial** folder for the users to know how to use your code. 

We are happy to see you contribute :).  

### **Creating a new Class**

* The header file/s must be in .h format.
* Always define the header files on the first and the second line(ifndef and define)
* Make sure the comments are exactly like it should be(see more [here](COMMENTS.md))
* Do not include <bits/stdc++.h> and only include libraries that you'll need in the class
* Make sure you use the **optimal** algorithms and not the ones that are slower
* You have to create a folder in the **tests** directory and test every function of your class, make sure you add a good ammount of test cases
* Add a small documentation .md file in the **tutorial** directory.


### **Fixing a bug**

* First and foremost, report the bug with an **Issue**
* if you are able to solve the issue yourself, then we are happy to see you solving the issue, otherwise, we hope that someone else will solve the issue.
